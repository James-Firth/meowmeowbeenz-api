MeowMeowBeenz let's you say how much you like, who you like, when you like, all from a standard non-Boost Mobile phone!

This project provides a restful API for powering the meowmeowbeenz mobile app.

## Progress

So far, this api handles signing up, logging in, rating, and searching users.

## Todo

The following features still need to be added:

* Send push notifications to mobile devices when they are given meowmeowbeenz or when their meowmeowbeenz level changes. I am thinking of using Amazon SNS ([with j7w1 gem](https://github.com/condor/j7w1)) for push notifications.
* Tests
